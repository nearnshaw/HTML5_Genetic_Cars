Leap Motion_Genetic_Cars
==================

A genetic algorithm car evolver in HTML5 canvas.

Using a Leap Motion controller you can draw your own car, that will compete with other randomly created cars.
Your´s won´t evolve like the others and so you will eventually see how the result of the genetic algorithm surpasses your own design.


This is inspired by BoxCar2D, and uses the same physics engine, Box2D, but it's written from scratch.

The original code is the code as published on http://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/
